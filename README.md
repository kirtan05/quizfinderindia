## What is this?

If you're into quizzing in India, you know the struggle: announcements scattered across dozens of WhatsApp groups, buried under memes and off-topic messages. Quiz Finder fixes that.

We monitor popular quizzing WhatsApp groups, automatically extract event details using AI, and present everything in a filterable feed. No more scrolling through 500 unread messages to find that one quiz poster.

## How It Works

Quiz announcements (text + poster images) are picked up from WhatsApp groups and run through GPT-4o, which extracts structured details: quiz name, date, time, venue, eligibility, team size, registration links, and more. High-confidence extractions are published automatically; ambiguous ones get flagged for review.
